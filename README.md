# Air Quality Index Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on air pollution data, leveraging various environmental and meteorological features to forecast AQI levels.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the factors affecting air quality.
- Utilize machine learning algorithms to predict AQI.
- Process and analyze environmental datasets.
- Deploy and evaluate predictive models.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information on air pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, and meteorological parameters. The data is sourced from official environmental monitoring agencies.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For data analysis and model development  

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Load and clean air quality datasets, handle missing values, and normalize data.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize data distributions and correlations among pollutants.  
3. **Feature Engineering**: Select relevant features influencing AQI.  
4. **Model Training & Evaluation**: Train multiple machine learning models and compare their performance.  
5. **Prediction & Analysis**: Use the best-performing model for AQI forecasting.  

## Problem Statement
Air pollution poses severe health risks, and real-time AQI prediction is crucial for public awareness and mitigation measures. This project aims to build a model that accurately predicts AQI levels based on air pollutant and meteorological data.

## Solution
A machine learning-based approach is used to predict AQI, employing various regression techniques. Feature selection and hyperparameter tuning enhance model accuracy.

## Results
- Model accuracy and error metrics are analyzed.
- Predictions are visualized using graphs.
- A comparison of different models is provided.
